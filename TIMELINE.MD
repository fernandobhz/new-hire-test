- Should I use stream to parse input? Choose the simple one, limiting the input size.
- Deduplication methods, what is the best method for this coding challenge? Choose: Upsert method
- Installing MSSQL package, dotenv package, configuring the connection.
- Creating documentation about how to install SQL Server and configure it to allow TCP/IP connections.
- Creating SQL Server tables.
- What primary keys should releases have? UPC seems to be obvious, but, there is some releases without it. I'm assuming that releases without UPC is a new release that doesn't have that number yet. We also have some releases without 2nd artist. I'm assuming title and release-date is the identifier for that table.
- Should I convert to camelCase or use as it's? Using it as it is, since SQL Server support kebab case.
- What is the max length of an UPC number? My research says 12 digits, but we have here 13-14 digits... I'm assuming a varchar(50) here, since I can't be sure of the amount of chars of that field.
- We don't have the max length for the title as well... Assuming nvarchar(300) , since we have to have less then 900 bytes of index and it gives a little bit extra space for other fields on others indexes.
- Assuming spofifyId as 40 chars, since that sha1 is the most likely  (maxlength) to use as and global id nowadays and it can handle uuid as well.
- genres filed i
- Others fields that we can't know the max size will be nvarchar(300)
- No one artists without spotifyId, assuming it as not null
- No one label without region, assuming it as not null
- No one release without title, assuming it as not null
- No one release without release-date, assuming it as not null
- No one release without label, assuming labelId as not null
- No one release without type, assuming typeId as not null
- I'll be using trunk-based over git flow since this is a code challenge and it doesn't make sense to have pull requests
- Resolving the enableArithAbort issue, it was a deprecated notice when connection
- I'm assuming that recors will be sent one by one, and not as a big array. If there is time I would implement an endpoint where it'll be able to receive a huge amount of data as a json array.
- Skipping data validation for now, I don't know if there is time to do so. But this is my first thing on todo list. A joi or express-openapi-validator
- Putting controllers and error handlers on todo list
- Simple label get post coded.... it's missing yet the dedup algorithm... it'll be done after all routes have been coded.
- Code organized
- Moving from kebab-case to camelCase on sql server.
- POST and GET of labels, artists and releases done but it's missing the dedup algorithm
- Assuming to only add new relations between releases and artist, since we have some with missing data.
- Dedup algorithm finished. Missing data validations and Queries.
- Queries finished
- I did have time to do all features that I want :-\ but I could complete what was requested
